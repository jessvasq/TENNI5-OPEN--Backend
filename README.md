# TENNI5-OPEN--Backend
Capstone Project. 

Tenni5 Open emerged as a response to the limited exposure and awareness of tennis in the United States. Despite significant attention and marketing efforts dedicated to events like the US Open, the sport often seemed to fade into obscurity. As a newcomer to tennis, I struggled to find like-minded beginners who shared the same enthusiasm and dedication to improving their skills. 

Tenni5 Open offers a platform for individuals of varying skill levels to organize matches or local tournaments in their vicinity. This not only facilitates connections with fellow tennis enthusiasts but also accommodates those who are uncertain about their skill level but eager to give tennis a try. 

Tenni5 Open extends a warm welcome to people of all ages and skill levels, encouraging them to explore the app and, most importantly, to take a leap into the world of tennis and become a part of our vibrant tennis community
