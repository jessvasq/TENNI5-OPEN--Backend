# TENNI5-OPEN--Backend
Capstone Project. 

Tenni5 Open was a vision that was created over the lack of exposure and familiarity with the sport of tennis within the US. Despite much attention and maketing placed with the US Open after all was set and done the sport cleared away, and for starters like myself it was hard to find fellow beginners that would share the same excitment and determination to grow as players.  

Tenni5 Open allows players from all different skill groups to host a match or a local tournament in their area and meet fellow tennis lovers or players who are not sure where they stand but would like to give it a go.  

Tenni5 Open welcomes everyone of all ages and skill level to not only try this app but most importantly to give tennis a try and join our tennis community. TENNIS ON!!!
